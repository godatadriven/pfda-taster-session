    "- Building a simple model with `scikit learn`\n",
    "- Scikit learn pipelines\n",
    "- Using pipelines in Pandas (or pandas chaining at the very least)\n",

    "The first manually operated computer system, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was invented in the 1940s. At that time the word “computer” was being used as a name for a human with intensive numerical computation capabilities, so, ENIAC was called a numerical computing machine! Well, you may say it has nothing to do with learning?! WRONG, from the beginning the idea was to build a machine able to emulate human thinking and learning.\n",

    "Thanks to statistics, machine learning became very famous in the 1990s. The intersection of computer science and statistics gave birth to probabilistic approaches in AI. This shifted the field further toward data-driven approaches. Having large-scale data available, scientists started to build intelligent systems that were able to analyze and learn from large amounts of data."
